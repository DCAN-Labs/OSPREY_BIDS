# Osprey-BIDS Derivative Tool

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/osprey-bids/badge/?version=latest)](https://osprey-bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This project is a derivative of [Osprey](https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey/), an open-source tool designed to facilitate the use of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) data in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This derivative tool extends the original functionalities to better facilitate automated processing of BIDS-formatted MRS data, and to allow localizer registration for aligning the MRS voxel high-resolution T1w/T2w images.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for this derivative tool is available at [Read the Docs](https://osprey-bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). All MRS modeling details are taken directly from the original Osprey tool, and [that documentation](https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey/) source should be considered the most up to date description of MRS modeling methodology.
